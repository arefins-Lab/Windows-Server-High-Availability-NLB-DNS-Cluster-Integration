Important Notes & Prerequisites
-------------------------------
Execution Policy: Before running any scripts, ensure your PowerShell execution policy allows script execution. 
Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force

Network Adapter Name: These scripts assume your network interface is named "Ethernet". If your VM uses a different name 
(e.g., "Ethernet0"), update the scripts accordingly.

Safe Mode Password: During the DC promotion (Install-ADDSForest), the script will pause and ask for a Directory Services 
Restore Mode (DSRM) password. This cannot be automated easily for security reasons.

Reboots: The Domain Controller will automatically reboot after promotion. This is normal.

Cluster Mode: The NLB cluster is configured in Multicast mode. Ensure your virtual switch (Hyper-V/VMware) supports 
MAC address changes and forged transmits if you face connectivity issues.

Firewall: For testing purposes, you might need to allow ICMP (Ping) and Port 80 (HTTP) through the Windows Firewall 
if the nodes can't talk to each other.
