NLB Cluster Infrastructure Setup
-------------------------------- 
This repository contains PowerShell scripts and documentation for setting up a Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) Cluster with a Domain Controller and two Web Servers.

Topology Overview
Domain Controller: DC-SRV01 (192.168.2.201)
Web Server 01: WEB-SRV01 (192.168.2.202)
Web Server 02: WEB-SRV02 (192.168.2.203)
Cluster VIP: 192.168.2.50
Domain: project.test

Step-by-Step Installation
-------------------------
1. Domain Controller (DC-SRV01)
First, configure the DC to handle DNS and Active Directory. Run the commands in scripts/dc-setup.ps1:

Renames server to DC-SRV01.
Sets static IP 192.168.2.201.
Installs AD DS and DNS roles.
Promotes to Forest project.test.

2. Web Servers (WEB-SRV01 & WEB-SRV02)
Prepare the nodes for the cluster. Run the scripts on each respective server:

Sets static IPs (.202 and .203).
Joins the domain (optional/manual) and points DNS to DC.
Installs IIS Web Server and NLB Feature.

3. Cluster Configuration
Once roles are installed, create the cluster:

Use New-NlbCluster to initialize with VIP 192.168.2.50.
Add nodes using Add-NlbClusterNode.
Verify with Get-NlbClusterNode.

How to Use the Scripts
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Clone this repository:

PowerShell

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the scripts/ folder and execute the .ps1 files sequentially.

✅ Verification
After setup, you can verify the load balancing by accessing: http://192.168.2.50 or http://project.test
